			Wafting through the air, the enticing smell of hazelnut coffee tickles the nose with its sweet aromatic essence. It is the breaking point at which gives strength and motivation for leaving the warmth of the covers. Upon entering the kitchen the sounds of the coffee maker proclaims it’s promise to satisfy as it pop, pop, hisses and the aroma of the coffee caresses your nose and tickles your senses. With the coffee pot in view, the step quickens in order to reach the cabinet and get a big coffee mug. With a little bit of sugar to sweeten the coffees already sweet hazelnut flavor, the coffee pot proclaims that its job is done with a final pop and hiss. Pouring the hot black liquid into the mug watching as the sugar melts and becomes one with the coffee, a taste is taken, deciding that a little more sweetness is desired, a little more sugar is added, and upon second taste the senses explode in the mouth as the tongue declares, “it is good!”
